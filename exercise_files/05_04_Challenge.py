# ## Faster Prime Finding
#
# Write a function that returns a list of all primes up to a given number.
#
# For each number, in order to determine if it is prime, take the following steps:
# 1. Find the square root of the number
# 2. Find all the primes up to that square root
# 3. Test to see if any of those primes are divisors
#
# If a number has no prime divisors, it is prime!
